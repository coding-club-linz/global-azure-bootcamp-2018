CosmosDB is a global distributed, multi-model database service and it's Cosmos DB’s all-in-one-approach is challenging other Cloud Databases. By providing features like 99.999% read availabilty with global scale and native access via MongoDB-, Cassandra-, GremlinGraph-, DocDB- and Table API it accomodates a broad range of developers looking for a ready-to-use database service without rewriting their applications.

While I cover topics about some general benefits of a global distributed database most of the talk I will spend most of the time on the new capabilities. I show you how to leverage the ChangeFeed-AP and benefit from the native integration in Auzure Functions. I also take you on a ride with the new MongoDB aggregation pipeline support and unique indexes, Gremlin Graph and also the new member CassandraAPI.
